## General Notes
For the best experience make sure the number of images you have in the carousel is at least two more than the number you have set for `numberVisibleItems`. If you would like to improve this code or have any suggestions let me know. Thanks.

## Properties

### numberVisibleItems: *integer* default:5
`numberVisibleItems` determines how many images will be visible in the carousel at a time.

### animationSpeed: *integer* default:3000
`animationSpeed` determines the amount of time (milliseconds) that passes during one slide transition.

### carouselSpeed: *integer*
`carouselSpeed` determines the amount of time between slide transitions.

### automaticPlay: *boolean*
`automaticPlay` if true will cause the carousel to play continuously without user interaction.

### pauseOnHover: *boolean*
`pauseOnHover` if true will cause the carousel to stop playing when the mouse hovers over in image in the carousel.

### easing: "swing"
`easing` controls how the sliding animation progresses over time by manipulating its acceleration
